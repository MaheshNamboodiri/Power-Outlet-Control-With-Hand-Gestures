# Power-Outlet-Control-With-Hand-Gestures

The purpose of this project is to create a system that runs to detect gestures shown, and enable user to automatically select a particular device, as and when required.
This prototype can be expanded as much as possible, depeding on application.

This prototype is built on Arduino UNO, with Pyfirmata library. The gesture recognition code is written in Python, which detects number of creases and accordingly calculates what number is shown by the user.
This, in turn, selects the appropriate device.
